                                   Our primary areas are Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Information Visualization.
                                   We connect <b>computational models</b>—AI, machine learning, and probabilistic forecasts—with users in domains like <b>education, policy-making, and politics</b>. We are particularly interested in  <b>data and AI literacy, decision-making, explainable AI, human-AI interaction, and uncertainty communication</b> (alphabetically).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    We welcome applicants with degrees in computer science and related disciplines.   
                                         We are committed to guiding each student toward a path that aligns with their background and goals.
                                        However, a complete lack of programming skills or severe discomfort with mathematics would significantly hinder your progress.
                                        Above all, <b>self-motivation and a keen interest</b> in pursuing research are critical.

                                    </p>

                                        The application deadline is <b><NormalA href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/grad/apply" text="December 20" /></b>.
                                        UMD CS utilizes an admission committee for reviewing applications. 
                                        Make sure to mention Fumeng as the faculty of interest when you apply. 
                                        Additionally,  UMD CS students who maintain good standing are typically funded throughout
                                        their Ph.D. program via teaching assistantships (TA), research assistantships (RA), or fellowships.

                                      <b>About emails</b>: While I welcome emails from prospective students, please be mindful that I receive hundreds of similar inquiries. 
                                      A single, short email with clear objectives is sufficient. There's no need for many follow-ups about the same inquiry. Sometimes no answer is the answer.
